Internet Technologies: Foundation for Full-Stack Development
The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) empowers you to build dynamic web applications. But this functionality relies on a robust foundation of internet technologies that facilitate communication and data exchange. Let's explore some key concepts:

1. Network Infrastructure:
Networks: The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers, allowing data to travel across continents.
Protocols: Standardized rules (like TCP/IP) govern how devices communicate and ensure data arrives correctly.
Routers: These act as traffic directors, sending data packets to their destinations on the network.

2. Client-Server Model:
Clients: Devices like your computer or phone that request information from servers.
Servers: Powerful computers that store and process data, responding to client requests.
HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol defines how clients and servers communicate (e.g., GET requests for retrieving data).

3. The World Wide Web (WWW):
Web Browsers: Software like Chrome or Firefox that interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages.
URLs: Uniform Resource Locators (like https://www.example.com) uniquely identify web resources.
DNS: Domain Name Servers translate human-readable URLs into numerical IP addresses that computers understand.

4. Application-Level Protocols:
RESTful APIs: These provide a structured way for applications to request and exchange data from servers.
WebSockets: Enable real-time, two-way communication between clients and servers, crucial for interactive features.
