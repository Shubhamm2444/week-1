HTML Tags: Building Blocks of Web Pages (MERN Stack)
In the realm of Full-Stack Development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the foundation for structuring web page content. These essential building blocks, known as HTML tags, define how elements are displayed within a web browser.

Understanding HTML Tags:
Structure: Tags come in pairs, typically an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>). The content between these tags defines the element's purpose.
Types of Tags: There's a vast array of HTML tags, each with a specific function. Common examples include:
<h1> to <h6>: Define headings of varying sizes.
<p>: Creates a paragraph for text content.
<a>: Enables hyperlinks for navigation.
<img>: Inserts images.
<ul> and <ol>: Create unordered and ordered lists, respectively.

  
HTML Tags and MERN Stack:
React Integration: While React.js handles UI components and interactivity, HTML provides the fundamental structure. React components are often rendered as HTML elements, allowing for a clean separation of concerns.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Frameworks like Express.js can generate HTML on the server-side, improving initial page load performance and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
